## Motivation

Large-scale image databases remain largely biased towards objects and activities encountered in a select few cultures. This absence of culturally-diverse images, which we refer to as the \enquote{hidden tail}, limits the applicability of pre-trained neural networks and inadvertently excludes researchers from under-represented regions. To begin remedying this issue, we curate Turath-150K, a database of images of Arab heritage that reflects objects, activities, and scenarios commonly found in the Arab world. As a consequence of Turath, we hope to engage machine learning researchers in under-represented regions, and to inspire the release of additional culture-focused databases.
