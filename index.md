## Motivation

Large-scale image databases remain largely biased towards objects and activities encountered in a select few cultures. This absence of culturally-diverse images, which we refer to as the \enquote{hidden tail}, limits the applicability of pre-trained neural networks and inadvertently excludes researchers from under-represented regions. To begin remedying this issue, we curate Turath-150K, a database of images of Arab heritage that reflects objects, activities, and scenarios commonly found in the Arab world. As a consequence of Turath, we hope to engage machine learning researchers in under-represented regions, and to inspire the release of additional culture-focused databases. 

## Description

Turath, in Arabic, roughly means heritage. Broadly, the database consists of objects, activities, and scenarios 
commonly encountered in the Arab World (from Mauritania in the West of Africa to Iraq). More specifically, there 
exist 3 distinct benchmark databases; Turath-Standard, Turath-Art, and Turath-UNESCO, whose contents are described
next.
