# Turath-150K Database

This repository contains the data for three distinct benchmark databases and
code for training and evaluating supervised neural networks on the task of 
image classification. 

Turath, in Arabic, roughly means heritage. Broadly, the database consists of objects, activities, and scenarios 
commonly encountered in the Arab World (from Mauritania in the West of Africa to Iraq). More specifically, there 
exist 3 distinct benchmark databases; Turath-Standard, Turath-Art, and Turath-UNESCO, whose contents are described
next. 

## Turath Benchmark Databases

### Turath Standard

This benchmark comprises images reflecting categories with low-level details (e.g., food and clothing) to those 
with high-level details (e.g., cities and architecture). It has a total of 12 macro, image-level categories, each of
which consist of more granular micro categories, with a total of Y. On average, each micro category contains between
50 and 500 images.

### Turath Art

This benchmark comprises images reflecting art pieces produced by Arab artists. It has a total of 391 image-level
categories with, on average, 50-500 images per category. The list of names of these artists, although far from
exhaustive, were obtained from the Barjeel Art Foundation [https://www.barjeelartfoundation.org/].

### Turath UNESCO
